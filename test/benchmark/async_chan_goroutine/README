The reason why the same reduction gets reported twice is due to how the process is reduced.
In one branch it starts by trying to synchronize on `t1`, which then inlines the process `main.main$1`, and then synchronizes.
On another branch it replaces the process first, and then tries to synchronize on the channel.
While not wrong, it is noisy to have (seemingly) the same reduction twice. We should look into refining that behavior.
